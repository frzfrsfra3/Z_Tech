## 1. Identified Flaws in the Original Code

1. **Memory Issues with Large Files**: 
   - The code reads the entire file into memory (`req.file.buffer.toString()`), which can crash the server with large CSV files.
   - It processes all records at once rather than streaming or batching.

2. **Poor Error Handling**:
   - No try-catch blocks to handle potential errors during parsing or database operations.
   - If one record fails, the entire operation fails without any indication of which record caused the problem.
   - No validation of input data (e.g., checking if price is a valid number).

3. **Inefficient Database Operations**:
   - Uses individual `await Property.create()` calls in a loop, creating N database queries for N records.
   - No transaction handling - if some records fail halfway through, the database is left in an inconsistent state.

4. **Security Concerns**:
   - No file size limits or content type validation.
   - No rate limiting to prevent abuse of this endpoint.
   - No validation that the brokerId actually belongs to the authenticated user.
