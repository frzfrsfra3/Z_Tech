1. **Job Queue Processing**:
   - Move the import process to a background job queue (Bull, Kue, or AWS SQS) to avoid blocking the main thread.
   - Return a job ID immediately and allow clients to poll for status.

2. **Enhanced Observability**:
   - Add detailed logging (Winston or similar) for tracking import jobs.
   - Implement metrics (Prometheus) to monitor import success/failure rates and performance.

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Add API rate limiting (express-rate-limit) to prevent abuse.
   - Consider per-user quotas for imports.

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Store failed records in a separate table for later analysis.
   - Provide an option to download a CSV with just the failed records.

5. **Data Validation Enhancements**:
   - Add duplicate detection before import.
   - Validate projectId against existing projects in the database.

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider using a dedicated database bulk import tool for very large files.
   - Implement streaming to disk for extremely large files instead of memory processing.

7. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add file content verification (not just extension checking).
   - Implement virus scanning for uploaded files.
   - Consider adding a CAPTCHA for high-volume imports.
